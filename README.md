Game Name: Dog Chase
By: Li Ying (Merissa) Tan

BASIC GAME PLAY

The game is a chaser game.
The player icon is a bone, and the "enemies" in the game are puppies.
The aim of the game is to avoid the puppies.
The bone follows the cursor as the player moves the mouse, and the puppies follow the bone.
The game starts off with one puppy. For every 350 frames that the player survives, a new puppy is added into the game, until there are 5 puppies.
If the puppies collide with the bone, the health bar decreases.
The game ends when the health bar depletes.

HIGH SCORE

The player score starts off at 0, and increases by 1 for every 350 frames that the player survives (when a new puppy is added into the game).
When the number of puppies reaches 5, no more new puppies are added.
The player score increases by 2 for every 350 frames that the player survives.
